*****IMPORTANT******
The most recent prototype USB PCB required changes to be made, I have updated the schematic and PCB layout, and tested by modifying
the PCB I have on hand, however caution should be used until the new prototype is verified. Once I have verified the changes I will remove this
notice.

The ATMEGA32U4 chips will need to be programmed with the arduino bootloader before they are put on the PCB. One option may be to remove the chips
from an arduino and transplant them. I accomplish this currently by using a jig that I will release the files for at a later time.

More will be added to this repo as I find time over the next week.

Please respect the license files found within this project. What we do, and the joy we gain from that would not be possible without those who shared the
information with us to start with. Please respect and honor that by doing the same with any works derived from this or other projects linked to in this repo.

Also my spelling sucks, so I apologize for any type-ohs that exist.
